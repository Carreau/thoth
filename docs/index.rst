Thoth
=====

An opinionated documentation builder based on sphinx.

Thoth is meant to be zero-configuration, it should works out of the box, and is
meant to publish multiple version of a documentation easy. 

Create an ``index.rst`` in a folder and run ``thoth``, your documentation will
be automatically built, in ``_build/html/X.y.z``. Thoth does not handle
auto-detecting versions numbers yet.
